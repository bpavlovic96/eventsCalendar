# Event Calendar

Event Calendar project allows a user to browse React commits as events sorted by date.

Single click allows a user to mark the event.
Double click allows a user to open a modal and see more commit information.

Commits are fetched once the user changes from month to month to improve performance.

Check package.json file to check the dependencies used.
